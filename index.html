        <p id="para1">Hey everyone! I'm Alex, I'm a student at Weber State University. I've been pursuing a degree in computer science
        and im not sure what it is specifically I want to go into but something in the computer programing field. I don't have
        much skill in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript yet so no judging yet. When I'm not messing around with schooling im doing one
        of two things. I'm either messing around with computer games, because those are so much fun, or im out camping or fishing
        somewhere I really enjoy being out in the wilderness unaffected but the city we live in. There is something peaceful
        about being out in nature.</p>
